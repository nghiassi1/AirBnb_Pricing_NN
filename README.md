# AirBnb_Pricing_NN
I conducted this project with the aim of predicting Airbnb rental prices using machine learning techniques. Airbnb is an online marketplace for short-term apartment and home rentals. In this project, I analyzed the AirbnbListing dataset and built neural network models to predict rental prices based on various attributes. Additionally, I wanted to compare the performance of these models with the regression models I previously used in Programming I, to determine which approach provides more reliable price predictions and discuss the reasons behind it.

To ensure the accuracy of my models, I performed data cleanup tasks on the initial dataset, which included 1711 observations and 13 variables related to Airbnb listings in the DC area. I converted categorical variables like "Superhost," "room_type," and "neighborhood" into numeric representations. I also transformed the "host_since" variable from an unformatted date format to a numerical variable called "years_host." After identifying and removing null values, I split the dataset into a 70/30 training and testing set. To prepare the variables for modeling, I applied min/max normalization.

Throughout the modeling process, I experimented with various neural network models, adjusting the activation type, the number of hidden layers, and the number of neurons. These models utilized logistic and tangent activations and varied in the configuration of layers and hidden neurons. Among the models, one model stood out as the strongest performer. It had the lowest RMSE, highest R2, and lowest MAE, indicating its superior predictive strength based on these measures.

When comparing the best-performing neural network model to the linear regression models used in Programming I, it exhibited a lower error rate (RMSE) and comparable performance in terms of R2. Although the fit of the linear regression model was better, the neural network model proved to be more reliable in predicting Airbnb prices. The low R2 and high RMSE values in both models may be attributed to noisy data or potential outliers. Further adjustments to the dataset could improve the models' performance.

In conclusion, this project demonstrated the effectiveness of neural network models in predicting Airbnb rental prices. It highlighted the need for careful data preprocessing and model selection to obtain accurate predictions. By comparing the neural network models with linear regression models, I found that the neural network model provided more reliable predictions, even though its fit was not as strong. The findings suggest potential areas for improvement, such as handling noisy data and outliers, to enhance the models' performance.
